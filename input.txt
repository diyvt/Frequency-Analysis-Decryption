We believe university-level education can be both high quality
and low cost. Using the economics of the Internet, we've connected some of the
greatest teachers to hundreds of thousands of students in almost every country
on Earth. Udacity was founded by three roboticists who believed much of the
educational value of their university classes could be offered online for very
low cost. A few weeks later, over 160,000 students in more than 190 countries
enrolled in our first class, "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence." The class
was twice profiled by the New York Times and also by other news media. Now we're
a growing team of educators and engineers, on a mission to change the future of
education.
