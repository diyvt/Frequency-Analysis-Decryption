This program takes a piece of text that has been encrypted with a random alphabet and a large file that is the same language.  It then does a frequency analysis of the letters and character pairs.  The character pairs are separated into groups of key types.  Certain character pairings are extra important for decryption the ones I identified were double letters, starting letters and ending letters.  For example in this readme file there are several words that start with 'c' but none that end in 'c'.
